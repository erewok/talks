## The Weird World of Open Source

## Finding something to work on

- By browsing Github: [github.com/explore](https://github.com/explore)
- To help a library you appreciate (big or small: they all need help!)
- When people are doing interesting work and you want to help them.
- If there's a particular problem you are interested in.
- When you find [a problem](https://github.com/encode/starlette/issues/898) that you [can fix](https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/900) in a library you are using.
- Your own fun, side projects (mazes, anyone?)

Today's example: [a documentation change](https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-downscaler/issues/122)

# Setup Your Workspace

1. Click "Fork repo".
1. Clone your fork to your local machine `$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME`
1. Set upstream:

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/UPSTREAD_USERNAME/REPO_NAME
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:erewok/starlette.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:erewok/starlette.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:encode/starlette.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:encode/starlette.git (push)
```

# What Does Our Fork Mean?

Most of the time we do not have any permissions to contribute _directly_ to a project on Github. That's why we work on a fork.

```
+-- "upstream"
|   +-- master
|   +-- branch_one
|   +-- branch_two
+-- our fork
|   +-- master (different from upstream!)
|   +-- branch_one
|   +-- some_other_branch
```

Github knows our fork has an "upstream" repo, which means it will target our pull requests there. It won't automatically keep our fork up to date!

**Important Note**: You must manually ensure that your fork's "master" branch matches upstream!

---

# Keeping your fork up to date

Any time upstream's "master" branch has changed, we need to incorporate those changes:

```sh
$ git checkout master
$ git pull upstream/master
$ git push
```

# Time to Hack!

1. Make your changes in a branch.
1. Figure out how to run the tests
1. Figure out how to run linting and/or code formatting
1. Push _your branch_ to _your forked repo_.
1. Visit in a browser and Github will show you a button to "Create a Pull Request."

# Make a Pull Request

Some tips:

- Politeness and great communication helps.
- Referring to an open issue helps.
- Anticipating or responding to questions helps.

Now it's time to wait!
